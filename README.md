# Stensborg A/S
This modification of an Epson ET-M1120 printer allows Stensborg's resin to be ejected onto a substrate in a specific thickness and pattern after which Stensborg's desktop machine is ideal for imprinting micro and nano structures.
For small batches, prototypes and teaching it substitutes the traditional K-bar while maintaining a nice even layer and allowing specific patterns to be printed if for example only a certain part of a substrate requires an imprinted pattern.

The 3D print files folder contain all required parts which needs to be printed. Both .STL .SLDPRT and .STEP files are available, should you need to alter some of the files.

The software folder contains the executable program through which the printer is controlled.

The manual contains instructions as to how the printer is disassembled, the new modifications are carried out, how the printer and software is used along with a list of tested specifications and finally a list of tips, tricks, warnings etc.

Any feedback is greatly appreciated.
